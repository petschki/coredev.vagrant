----------------

- Create a coredev branch and repo based on plonedev_vagrant,


4.3.1 (2013-06-19)
------------------

- Update to Plone 4.3.1

- Add git.

- Create a plink.cmd for Windows. Use it for launching plonectl, kill_plone,
  buildout. Fixes issue #2 (thanks, albieback).

- The kill_plone script would fail if there was no space at the start
  of ps output. Fixed.

- Revise strategy for windows putty commands so that they'll
  search x86 program files on x64 systems. Give up on searching
  path. (Thanks, dthomas218)

- Use Ubuntu's current URL for Precise; avoid bug upgrade download.
